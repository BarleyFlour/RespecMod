Explanation of features

 Level Down

  Allows you to decrease your level (mythic or last taken normal class level)

  This also removes Feats and Ability Score/Skillpoints

  albeit with a catch related to Ability Scores and Skillpoints

  due to the game not storing data related to what skillpoint and ability score

  selections you made it will only be able to do so if the mod has the data via

  being installed when you leveled up, if it doesnt have the data it will refund

  all skill points and not decrease ability score.

  Selections on the class sheet will not be removed until you level up the relevant class and change the selection.

 Respec

  Allows you to level your character from level 0 instead of the normal level that they start at.
